                <h2>OpenSBLI</h2>
                <p>A framework for the automated derivation of finite difference solvers from high-level problem descriptions.</p>
            </header>
            <p>OpenSBLI is a Python-based modelling framework that is capable of expanding a set of differential equations written in Einstein notation, and automatically generating C code that performs the finite difference approximation to obtain a solution. This C code is then targetted with the <a href="http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/projects/ops">OPS library</a> towards specific hardware backends, such as MPI/OpenMP for execution on CPUs, and CUDA/OpenCL for execution on GPUs.</p>

<p>The main focus of OpenSBLI is on the solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with application to shock-boundary layer interactions (SBLI). However, in principle, any set of equations that can be written in Einstein notation may be solved.</p>

            <ul class="feature-icons">
                <li class="fa-code">Express the differential equations to be solved in Einstein/index notation</li>
                <li class="fa-cubes">OPS-compliant C code that solves the equations is automatically generated</li>
                <li class="fa-cubes">Code is targetted towards various backends, including MPI, CUDA, OpenCL and OpenACC using the OPS library</li>
                <li class="fa-code">Open-source project, released under the GNU General Public License</li>
                <li class="fa-coffee">Separation of concerns: model development is kept separate from backend support</li>
                <li class="fa-coffee">Example applications and user documentation are available</li>
